I am a PhD candidate in the Human-machine interface (HMI) Lab lead by [Prof. Milin Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=otyvO5AAAAAJ) in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University. I received my bachelor degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University in 2020.

Research Interests
======
My research focus on low power EEG processing in brain-machine interface (BMI) or brain-computer interface (BCI). Recently I am paying attention to prefrontal EEG based consiousness evaluation, which mainly consists of three tasks: anesthesia depth monitoring, sleep staging and sustained attention evaluation.
